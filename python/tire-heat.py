"""The graph is labeled well, though I am unsure what the numbers next to the different colors mean.

# How readable is the code itself?
# Say where formatting or commenting would make the code more readable or where PEP-8 is violated.
"""Fairly readable. In the beginning I am unsure where the masses array (line 13) comes from and the url data (line 26)

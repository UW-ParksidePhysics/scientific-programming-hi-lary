# Does the code run without error?
## yes, it ran without error
# If any error occurs, can you suggest a potential fix?
## N/A
# How understandable is the output of the code?
## To find the force in Newtons from its displacement
# Point out any parts you do not understand.
## On line 28 why did they put kg in the comment instead of the code itself
# How readable is the code itself?
## There are comments spread throughput to inform us what they were trying to conclude.
# Say where formatting or commenting would make the code more readable or where PEP-8 is violated.
## Commenting was used often, it helps the reader to understand why the number seen is there.
# How clearly do the code comments describe the problem it is trying to solve?
## The code comments are really well thought out.
# Identify places that would benefit from a clearer comment.
## Line 21, could use a clearer comment because it states that the thrust block should be double checked, they could say (has been checked)
# How clearly do the variable names relate to the concepts they concretize?
## Variable names are well thought out and are not similar to other names in its catagory
# Point out any variables you don't recognize, and/or suggest better names. Check for PEP-8 compliance.
## They used thrust, collective, and mass for the three different rockets. It is pretty simple naming
# How well does the range of variables capture the problem described?
## The objects are so large... being planets and rockets that the range of variables are fairly similar
# Identify extraneous regions that could be left out or important regions that should be included.
## The code is small and only uses 51 lines, keeping it simple helps to keep track of information
# To what degree does the script follow a functional programming paradigm, packaging all major components of the script
# into separately defined functions that pass information among them in a small number of lines? Identify ways in which
# the functionalization of the code could be improved.
## The plots from the code seem kinda basic, although it is a rough version, it will look better in the future
# How clearly do the visualizations show the solutions to the problem?
## There are three seperate graphs that are produced. if graphs were to be titled and labeled, it may be easier to read
# Say if there is extraneous whitespace or the co-domain or domain of the data should be changed or any other ways the
# visualizations could be more effective
## The scale for the images seems to be ok as the line ends at both ends of the page. the only thing I would
##  add would be titles and x/ylabels
